    <h1 class = h1-text>Reflection</h1>
    <p class = "para-para">Throughout the fall semester of 2018, I worked as the sole designer responsible to set the scope of the project and work on the solution.<strong>This project introduced me to the idea of rapid user testing and incorporating changes into the ideas and solution from small-N user testing exercises every week before jumping into the Artsy visual design part</strong> . This project was almost like a sprint which followed Agile methodologies, and throughout the semester, I enjoyed getting constructive feedback on my ideas.</p>
    <p class = "para-para">Even though this was a semester project, but I am happy that I got an opportunity to work on a problem that is very prominent in places like India. The User testing exercises helped me to look at the problem from the minds of my peers group, that in itself was very diverse. The combination of a diverse peer group and the project opportunity helped me grow a lot.</p>
