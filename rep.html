Also, a free trial should set the product up for the users such that they experience minimum cognitive load. That is, all they have to do is click a button to get the result.</p>

I started experimenting with different non-tech and tech solutions, like designing a customized workflow for the sales and onboarding team, a customized handout document/video for the new users, or designing a free trial for the product. While the nontech solutions had some advantages like ease of implementation, the disadvantages like the significant effort from the users' side and asking the sales team to invest their valuable selling time led me to drop them and go forward with the Free trial idea. The free trial would help the new users to learn about the product in their own time and let the sales and onboarding team can use that teaching time to find new potential clients. <br><br>
Therefore, the product team went forward with the <strong>free trial idea</strong> . </p>
